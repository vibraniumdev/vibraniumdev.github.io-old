My name is Guilherme Teixeira. I'm a front-end developer and an\n        undergraduate Linguistics student.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Although my tech career began almost 10 years ago, I've made my first\n        steps into software development in 2017 when I started learning Python\n        in the college. Less than one year later, I was already working as a Python\n        software development intern. After that I took the oportunity to work\n        as a computational linguist (NLP) intern. In 2020, I accepted the\n        challenge of starting over.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Currently I am a front-end developer at Printi, the biggest online\n        printing company in Brazil. I'm constantly improving my knowledge about\n        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as ReactJS, NextJS and GatsbyJS.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As a college student, my topics of interest are theoretical linguistics,\n        mainly Generative Syntax, Formal Semantics, Epistemology, Analytic\n        Philosophy, and Language Acquisition.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I love computers, progressive metal, rollerblades, and Basketball since\n        the childhood. I also enjoy reading about science fiction, fantasy, and\n        philosophy. When I grew older, I've found out that I also love science\n        and grammar, so I decided to join a bachelor degree called Linguistics,\n        which is the field of study that has language as its main scientific\n        object.\n      </p>\n    </AboutContent>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default About\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
