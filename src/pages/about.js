            I am a software developer based in Brazil, and I have been working
            in the tech industry for about {YOE} years, {frontendYOE} of which
            as a front-end developer. My ultimate goal is to improve people's
            lives through technology â€” and to try to make the World a better
            place using the resources we have at hand right now.
          </Typography>
          <br />
          <Typography>
            Before working with front-end development, I have worked with
            Python/Django. After that, I did an internship working with Natural
            Language Processing and Machine Learning using Python again, this
            time with spaCy.

          <Typography>
            Even though I can consider myself a front-end specialist nowadays,
            my interests are far from being restricted to interfaces and user
            experience. Actually, my next main goal is to learn Elixir and
            Functional Programming.
