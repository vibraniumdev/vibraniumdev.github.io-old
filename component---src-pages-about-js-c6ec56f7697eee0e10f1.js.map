My name is Guilherme Teixeira. I'm a front-end developer and an\n        undergraduate Linguistics student.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Although my tech career began almost 10 years ago, I've made my first\n        steps into software development in 2017 when I started learning Python\n        in the college. One year later, I was already working as a Python\n        software development intern. Afther that I took the oportunity to work as a\n        computational linguist (NLP) intern. In 2020, I accepted the challenge\n        of starting over.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Currently I work as a front-end developer at the biggest online printing\n        company in Brazil. I'm constantly improving my knowledge about HTML,\n        CSS, and JavaScript, as well as ReactJS, NextJS and GatsbyJS.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As a college student, my topics of interest are theoretical linguistics,\n        mainly Generative Syntax, Formal Semantics, Epistemology, Philosophy of\n        Language (Analytic Philosophy), and Language Acquisition.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I love computers, progressive metal, rollerblades, and NBA since the\n        childhood. I also enjoy reading about science fiction, fantasy, and\n        philosophy. When I grew older, I've found out that I also love science\n        and grammar, so I decided to join a bachelor degree called Linguistics,\n        which is the one that has language as its main scientific object of\n        study.\n      </p>\n    </AboutContent>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default About\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
