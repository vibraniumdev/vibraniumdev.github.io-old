My name is Guilherme Teixeira. I'm a front-end developer and an\n        undergraduate Linguistics student.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I've made my first steps into software development in 2017 when I\n        started learning Python in the college. Less than one year later, I was\n        already working as a Python software development intern. After that I\n        took the opportunity to work as a computational linguist (NLP) intern. In\n        2020, I accepted the challenge of starting over.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Currently I am a front-end developer at Printi, the biggest online\n        printing company in Brazil. I'm constantly improving my knowledge about\n        JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, as well as ReactJS, NextJS and GatsbyJS.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As a college student, my topics of interest are theoretical linguistics,\n        mainly Generative Syntax, Formal Semantics, Epistemology, Analytic\n        Philosophy, and Language Acquisition.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I love computers, Progressive Metal, rollerblades, and Basketball since\n        I was a kid. I also enjoy reading about science fiction, fantasy, and\n        philosophy. When I grew older, I've found out that I also love science\n        and grammar, so I decided to join a bachelor degree called Linguistics,\n        which is the field of study that has language as its main scientific\n        object.\n      </p>\n    </AboutContent>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default About\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
